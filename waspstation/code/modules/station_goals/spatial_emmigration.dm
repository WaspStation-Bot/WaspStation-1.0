	 NT Scientists have determined that this event is irreversable and will require execution of CASE OMEGA.
	 CASE OMEGA instructs all orbital stations to construct Interdimensional Escape Bridges and evacuate through them before the effects of the event reach your station.
	 This is a one way trip. Bring only what is essential to your survival. We do not know what may await you on the other side.
	 Specifications for emergency evacuation equipment is being made available to all NT/SolGov stations in the sector.
	 There will be no further evacuation shuttles. All crew-safe logistical infrastructure has been dedicated to distributing evacuation equipment to underequipped stations.
	 Syndicate Forces are guaranteed to attempt to evacuate through your gate. Ensure they do not succeed.
	 You will have an estimated <b>90 minutes</b> until the cascade event reaches your station.
